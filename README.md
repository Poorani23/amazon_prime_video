# Amazon Prime Video Data Analysis

This project aims to analyze the Amazon Prime Video dataset using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The dataset consists of 9,668 rows and 12 columns, containing information about movies and TV shows available on Amazon Prime Video.

## Project Steps

1. **Import Python Libraries**: The required Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn) are imported for data manipulation and visualization.

2. **Load the Dataset**: The dataset is loaded from a Google Drive location.

3. **Data Understanding**: The number of rows, columns, and null values in the dataset are explored.

4. **Data Preprocessing**: Unnecessary columns are dropped, and column names are renamed for clarity.

5. **Duplicate Handling**: Duplicate columns are identified and combined if necessary.

6. **Column Analysis**: Specific columns are analyzed for their data types and duplicate values.

7. **Visualization**: Several visualizations are created to gain insights from the data:
  - Distribution of movie and TV show releases over the past decade, using a histogram.
  - Top 5 countries contributing content to Amazon Prime Video, represented by a bar chart.
  - Correlation between the release year and duration of movies, using a scatter plot.
  - Distribution of ratings (e.g., PG, PG-13, R) among movies, displayed as a bar chart.
  - Genre distribution of TV shows on Amazon Prime Video, visualized using a pie chart.
  - Top 10 directors with the most content available on Amazon Prime Video, shown as a bar chart.
